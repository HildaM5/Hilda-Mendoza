<p>I really like how Science and Engineering can come together can create amazing things! That's why I took an Engineering course offered at my school during my sophomore year. My classmates and I had such amazing and exciting activities. One of my favorites is the E-nable project. My team and I had to create an E-nable hand. This prothesis' measurements were taken from photos in scale sent of the receiver, who was a little girl in Texas. My favorite part of doing the activity was that the E-nable hand was going to be used by children who really needed it. It was made out of 3D printed plastic parts, elastic thread and regular thread. It felt great to help somebody. I really enjoyed working with my team to do a good in society. </p>

<p>I am also interested in Computer Science. I didn't know how amazing it was until I was exposed to it during Girls Who Code, which has been one of the best experiences of my life so far. In the future, I would love to use technology to help others and make an even better world! I am looking forward to learn everyday new things and to get out of my confort zone.</p>

<p>My favorite project with Girls Who Code is the MP3 player created in scratch because it was so much fun to write the pseudo and the actual code with my partner, Katia. She and I practically did't stop working on the project and making it even better until we run out of time! It was very exciting on how imagination and creativity is the key part on finishing designing a project.</p>
